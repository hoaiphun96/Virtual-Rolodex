# Virtual Rolodex
This is a small app I did for a 3 hours coding challenge. Virtual Rolodex reads in contacts from a JSON file and showcases individual cards against a colored background, and allows user to move between them horizontally

## App Specifications
Virtual Rolodex is built using the latest XCode 9.2 version and is compatible with iOS version 10.3 and beyond

## Features
Virtual Rolodex allows the user to
- Toggle between contacts by swiping left or right
- View avatar and details of each contact
